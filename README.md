## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first Workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) - API

### What I learned

I felt myself more confidentt to work with API's since I had some difficults before to fetch the data. I actually didn't know how to do it properly even seen some tutorials. Now I could improve myself with it's usage and then do a good job. Also I could improve my skills with VueJS and it's Composition API.

### Continued development

I'll continue improving my skills with Vue and APIs, there are a lot of challenges and numerous APIs I can use in projects, and try to learn new frameworks/libs to increase my curriculum.

### Useful resources

- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) - API source;
- [Aprenda Fetch API de Javascript com Projeto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIGYM4S8x50&t=1149s) - With this video I could dive myself into the api world, I still don't master it, but I could improve even more my knowledge about it.
